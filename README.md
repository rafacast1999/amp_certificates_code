# Cisco Secure Endpoint Certificate Validator
Authored by Rafa Castro (rafacast@cisco.com)

## Overview
The script validates whether a specified endpoint has the necessary certificates installed to ensure the proper operation of Cisco Secure Endpoint. It adheres to the guidelines provided in [Cisco's documentation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/amp-endpoints/216943-list-of-root-certificates-required-for-a.html). The script is Python-based and can be executed through the command line on an endpoint with Python installed or via Orbital if the Scripts feature is enabled. Refer to Orbital's [documentation](https://orbital.amp.cisco.com/help/orbital-settings-org-tab/#script_on) for more details.

## Requirements
- Python v3.9 or higher
- Windows 10 or later

## How to Use:
### Running the script via Orbital
- Open the Cisco Orbital console
- Navigate to the 'Investigate' tab
- Choose the Windows endpoints where you want to execute the script
- Select the 'Script' option
- Paste the contents of the "se_certificate_validator.py" script into the custom script text field
- Click 'Run script'
### Running the script via command prompt
```sh
C:\Users\<user>\Downloads\se_certificate_validator> python se_certificate_validator.py
```

## Output
The script generates a list of certificates, prioritizing the absent certificates at the start of the list. It then follows with the list of required certificates that are already installed. An example of the output is as follows. For instructions on how to install a missing certificate, refer to this [link](https://youtu.be/jc_b6rQpDMc?si=Jriywsp2cQyov_r9).
